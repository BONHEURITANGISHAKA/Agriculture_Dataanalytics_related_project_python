# Fish Farm IoT Data Analysis: Optimizing Aquaculture Operations

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of IoT sensor data from a fish farm, focusing on key water quality parameters: water temperature, pH, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). Leveraging Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this analysis aims to identify trends, detect anomalies, and derive actionable insights to optimize fish farm operations, ensure fish health, and enhance productivity.

## Key Features

-   **Data Understanding & Preprocessing:** Thorough inspection of dataset structure, data types, and initial statistics, followed by cleaning (datetime conversion, missing value, and duplicate handling).
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Modern Visuals:** In-depth analysis of water temperature, pH, and TDS distributions using attractive histograms, box plots, and density plots. Visualization of parameter relationships through pair plots.
-   **Time-Series Trend Analysis:** Engaging time-series plots to visualize the temporal patterns and fluctuations of water temperature, pH, and TDS, revealing critical operational dynamics.
-   **Anomaly Detection:** Implementation of a statistical method (IQR-based outlier detection) to identify unusual readings in water parameters, indicating potential system malfunctions or critical conditions affecting fish health.
-   **Actionable Insights & Recommendations:** Formulation of clear, business-impact-focused recommendations based on analytical findings, aimed at optimizing operational protocols, preventing issues, and improving overall farm efficiency and profitability.

## Business Impact & Value Proposition

This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw IoT data into strategic business insights. By identifying critical thresholds and potential operational inefficiencies, it proposes solutions that can lead to:

-   **Reduced Fish Stress & Mortality:** Proactive management of water quality parameters.
-   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Efficient feeding and water management strategies.
-   **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Implementation of automated alert systems and root cause analysis protocols.
-   **Increased Yield & Profitability:** By maintaining optimal environmental conditions for fish.

This analysis showcases strong skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, modern data visualization, and the ability to derive commercially relevant insights from complex datasets – all crucial for roles in data science and analytics, particularly within the aquaculture or IoT sectors.
